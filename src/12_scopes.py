# When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.
x = 12


def changeX():
    global x
    x = 99

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in changeX() to get it to print 99?

# This nested function has a similar problem.

    # 999? Google "python nested function scope".
